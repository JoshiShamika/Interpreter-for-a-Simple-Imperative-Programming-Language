# Interpreter-for-a-Simple-Imperative-Programming-Language
The file 'Sec3Proj1Team2Step3.ml.txt' contains SML code for an interpreter defined using an abstract syntax for a Graal - like language.
I have defined various components of a language like constructors, type constructors and recursions in type definition.
Worked on the static semantics and dynamic semantics for the imperative language and tested the working of interpreter using sample code for strong numbers.
The results for this project are available in 'Sec3Proj1Team2Step3Results.txt' file.
